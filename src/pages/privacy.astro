        <strong>{site.title}</strong> respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect,
        how we use it, and what rights you have.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses <strong>Umami</strong>, a privacy-focused, self-hosted analytics platform. Umami does not
        use cookies, does not collect personal data, and does not track you across sites. All data is
        aggregate-only — we see page view counts and referrer sources, not individual visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        No personal information is stored by our analytics. No fingerprinting. No IP logging.
        Umami is GDPR-compliant by design.
      </p>

      <h2>Newsletter</h2>
      <p>
        If you subscribe to the newsletter, your email address is stored by <strong>Mailchimp</strong>,
        our email service provider. We collect your email address only — nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every newsletter includes an unsubscribe link. We do not sell, share, or rent your email
        address to any third party, ever.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        This site does not set tracking cookies. Our analytics platform (Umami) is cookieless.
        However, if you interact with embedded Mailchimp signup forms, Mailchimp may set its own
        cookies according to their privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact Messages</h2>
      <p>
        If you reach out via the contact page or email, your message goes directly to the site owner.
        Messages are not stored in any database, CRM, or third-party platform beyond standard email.
      </p>

      <h2>External Links</h2>
      <p>
        This site contains links to external websites (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.). We are not responsible
        for the privacy practices of those sites. When you follow an external link, you are subject
        to that site's privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request what information (if any) we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data (e.g., newsletter unsubscription)</li>
        <li>Ask questions about this policy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise any of these rights, email <a href={`mailto:${site.author.email}`}>{site.author.email}</a>.
