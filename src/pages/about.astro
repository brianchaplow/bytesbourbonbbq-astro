        <strong>Bytes • Bourbon • BBQ</strong> is where cybersecurity meets live-fire cooking. 
        Real BBQ. Real photos. Real engineering mindset.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Every cook is a mission. Every recipe has variables, constraints, and an after-action report. 
        We approach the pit the same way we approach security operations: with methodology, 
        measurement, and continuous improvement.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Author</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <a href={site.author.website}>Brian Chaplow</a>, a 26-year U.S. Navy veteran turned 
        cybersecurity professional. I bring mission discipline to both domains: clear procedures, 
        rapid decisions, and rigorous documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        By day, I work in threat intelligence and SOC operations. By night, I tend fire and smoke.
        The skills transfer more than you'd expect.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why BBQ + Cyber?</h2>
      <p>
        Both require:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Observation</strong> — Reading the smoke, reading the logs</li>
        <li><strong>Patience</strong> — Low and slow, or fast and focused</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptation</strong> — No cook goes exactly to plan</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation</strong> — What worked, what didn't, what's next</li>
      </ul>
