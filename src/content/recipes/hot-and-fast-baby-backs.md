  - pork

  - baby-backs
  - smoking
  - ooda
  - hot-and-fast
ingredients:
  - "2 racks baby back ribs"
  - "Yellow mustard (binder)"
  - "Meat Church Holy Gospel rub (or favorite SPG-based rub)"
  - "Apple cider vinegar in spray bottle"
  - "4 tbsp butter (1 tbsp per half rack)"
  - "Your favorite BBQ sauce"
  - "Pecan wood for smoke"
  - "Heavy duty aluminum foil"
instructions:
  - "Remove membrane from bone side of ribs using paper towel for grip."
  - "Apply thin coat of yellow mustard as binder, then season generously with rub on all sides."
  - "Set smoker/grill to 300°F indirect heat with pecan wood."
  - "Place ribs meat side up. Spray with ACV at 30 and 60 minute marks."
  - "At roughly 1 hour, check for caramelization. When bark has formed, move to wrap phase."
  - "Lay butter pats on heavy duty foil, place ribs meat side down on butter, splash with ACV, wrap tightly."
  - "Return to grill for approximately 45 minutes to braise."
  - "Unwrap, place meat side up, brush with sauce, return to grill for 10-15 minutes."
  - "Bend test: lift from center with tongs. Slight tear = toothsome (210°F). Clean break = fall-off (215°F)."
  - "Rest 5 minutes, then slice from bone side for cleaner cuts."
aar:
  worked: "300°F cut total cook time nearly in half versus 3-2-1 with no quality loss. ACV sprays kept the surface moist during high-heat phase. Bend test proved far more reliable than time-based targets."
  adjust: "Try 275°F next time for slightly more smoke penetration while keeping the accelerated timeline. Consider honey in the wrap for a glaze option."
  lessons: "Indicator-based cooking beats time-based every time. The caramelization tells you when to wrap, not the clock. Hot and fast demands tighter OODA loops—you can't zone out."

**You don't fly a fighter jet on a preset flight plan.**

You observe. You orient. You decide. You act. Then you do it again—faster than your adversary can respond.

Colonel John Boyd developed the OODA Loop to explain why some pilots consistently won dogfights while others didn't. It wasn't reflexes or aircraft specs. It was decision speed. The pilot who could cycle through observe-orient-decide-act faster controlled the engagement.

BBQ works the same way. Especially hot and fast.

At 300°F, you don't have the luxury of "set it and forget it." The margin for error shrinks. The cook moves faster. You need tighter decision loops—constant observation, rapid orientation, clear decision points, immediate action.

## The OODA Framework

| Checkpoint | Observe | Orient | Decide | Act |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|-----|
| 30 min | Color development, moisture level | Compare to expected progress | Continue or adjust temp? | Spray ACV, close lid |
| 60 min | Bark formation, color deepening | How close to wrap-ready? | Another spray cycle or prep for wrap? | Spray ACV, assess |
| ~1 hour | Caramelization level | Is the bark set enough to wrap? | Wrap now or give it more time? | Execute wrap or continue |
| ~45 min wrapped | Meat pullback, foil tightness | Is braising complete? | Unwrap and sauce? | Execute or extend |
| 10-15 min sauced | Bend test results | Toothsome or fall-off? | Pull now or push further? | Pull and rest |

Every checkpoint is an OODA cycle. You gather data, interpret it against your mental model, make a call, and execute. Then you reset and do it again.

## Why Hot and Fast?

Traditional low-and-slow (225-250°F) is forgiving. You have wide margins. Time estimates are reliable because the thermal dynamics are slower.

Hot and fast (275-325°F) is different:
- **Faster Maillard reaction** — bark develops quicker
- **Shorter cook window** — less time to course-correct
- **More active management** — you're flying the plane, not on autopilot

The tradeoff? You finish in 2.5-3 hours instead of 5-6. Same quality. Half the time. But you earn it through attention.

## The Security Parallel

In cybersecurity, we talk about reducing attack surface and tightening feedback loops. Hot and fast BBQ is the same concept:

- **Reduced exposure time** = less time for things to go wrong
- **Tighter monitoring** = faster detection of anomalies
- **Rapid response** = course correction before cascade failure

The 3-2-1 method is like quarterly security audits—structured, predictable, but slow to adapt. OODA-based cooking is continuous monitoring with automated response. Same goal, different tempo.

## Final Notes

The times in this recipe are guidelines, not rules. Your smoker runs different than mine. Your ribs are different thickness. Your ambient temperature matters.

What doesn't change: the indicators. Bark formation. Meat pullback. Bend test. These are your telemetry. Trust the data, not the clock.

That's the OODA way.
