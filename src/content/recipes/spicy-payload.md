ingredients:
  - "12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled"
  - "1/4 cup Kewpie mayo (Japanese version, not American formula)"
  - "1 tbsp Dijon mustard"
  - "1 tbsp horseradish (fresh grated preferred; prepared creamy for milder heat)"
  - "1 tsp apple cider vinegar"
  - "1 tsp Cajun seasoning"
  - "1-2 tbsp finely diced pickled jalapeño"
  - "Apple or cherry wood for smoke"
  - "Paprika for garnish"
  - "Fresh jalapeño slices for garnish"
instructions:
  - "Hard-boil 12 eggs, then chill and peel."
  - "Pat eggs completely dry to prevent surface bubbling during smoke."
  - "Smoke whole peeled eggs at 160-180°F for 15-30 minutes with light apple or cherry smoke."
  - "Halve eggs lengthwise and remove yolks to a bowl."
  - "Mash yolks with mayo, Dijon, horseradish, vinegar, and Cajun seasoning until smooth."
  - "Fold in diced jalapeño. Taste and adjust seasoning and heat."
  - "Pipe or spoon filling into whites."
  - "Garnish with jalapeño slices and paprika. Serve chilled or room temp."
aar:
  worked: "Light smoke at 160°F added depth without overwhelming the delicate egg flavor. Kewpie mayo made the filling noticeably more addictive than regular mayo. The delayed heat hit landed exactly as planned—2-3 seconds after the initial bite."
  adjust: "Fresh grated horseradish next time for sharper heat spike versus the slow burn of prepared. Could smoke eggs slightly longer (25-30 min) for more pronounced smoke ring. Test smoked paprika as garnish for extra smoke layer."
  lessons: "Payload delivery is all about timing—the familiar elements lower defenses before the heat arrives. Drying the eggs completely is non-negotiable for clean smoke adhesion. These hold for hours, making them perfect make-ahead party food."

**Nobody sees it coming.**

That's the point. They pick up what looks like a classic deviled egg—creamy, familiar, safe. The smoke hits first. Subtle. Then the Dijon. Then, three seconds later, the jalapeño and horseradish arrive and suddenly they're reaching for their drink.

That's payload delivery.

## The Attack Chain

In cybersecurity, the **payload** is the end of the kill chain—the code that actually executes after all the groundwork is done. Initial access gets you through the door. Privilege escalation gets you the keys. Defense evasion keeps you hidden. But the payload? That's the mission. That's what you came here to do.

Everything else is delivery mechanism.

These eggs work the same way. You don't lead with heat—you build to it. Each layer has a job, and the job is getting that jalapeño-horseradish punch past their defenses.

## Equipment

- Smoker or grill with lid (Big Green Egg, kettle, whatever holds temp)
- Piping bag or zip-lock with corner cut (optional but cleaner)
- Instant-read thermometer

## Ingredients

### The Carrier (Initial Access)
- 12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled

### The Payload
- 1/4 cup Kewpie mayo (Japanese formula—the MSG is the point, don't substitute)
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp horseradish (fresh grated for sharper heat, prepared creamy for longer burn)
- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp Cajun seasoning
- 1-2 tbsp finely diced pickled jalapeño

### The Smoke Vector
- Apple or cherry wood (light and sweet—you're not making jerky)

### The Garnish (Social Engineering)
- Paprika (makes them look harmless)
- Fresh jalapeño slices (visible warning for the observant)

## Instructions

### Stage 1: Establish the Carrier

Hard-boil 12 eggs, then chill completely and peel.

This is your delivery mechanism. Nothing fancy—just solid, reliable infrastructure. You need these to be structurally sound because they're carrying the payload.

### Stage 2: Prepare for Infiltration

Pat eggs **completely dry** with paper towels.

This step is non-negotiable. Moisture on the surface causes smoke particulate to stick and turn bitter—like a malformed packet that corrupts the whole transmission. Dry surface = clean smoke adhesion = better flavor delivery.

### Stage 3: Initial Access (The Smoke)

Smoke whole peeled eggs at 160-180°F for 15-30 minutes with apple or cherry wood.

Light smoke only. You're not trying to overwhelm—you're trying to slip past the palate's defenses. The smoke is your initial access vector: aromatic, subtle, lowers their guard. They taste "smoky" and think they know what they're getting.

They don't.

### Stage 4: Persistence Mechanism

Halve eggs lengthwise. Remove yolks to a bowl.

The hollowed whites are your persistence layer—the stable platform that keeps your payload in place until execution. Structural integrity matters here. Be gentle.

### Stage 5: Build the Payload

Mash yolks with mayo, Dijon, horseradish, vinegar, and Cajun seasoning until smooth. Then fold in the diced jalapeño.

This is your malicious code. The mayo provides cover—creamy, familiar, expected. The Dijon adds complexity that distracts from what's underneath. The horseradish and jalapeño are the actual payload: they hit 2-3 seconds after the first bite, after the target has already committed.

Taste and adjust. You're calibrating your exploit for the target environment.

### Stage 6: Deploy

Pipe or spoon filling into whites.

Clean deployment. No spillage, no evidence of tampering. The payload should sit neatly in the carrier, looking exactly like what the target expects to see.

### Stage 7: Social Engineering

Top with paprika and fresh jalapeño slices.

The paprika is misdirection—it makes them look like every deviled egg they've ever eaten. The jalapeño slice is plausible deniability: you warned them, technically. If they ignore the warning, that's on them.

Serve chilled or at room temperature.

## Pitmaster Notes

**Fresh vs. prepared horseradish:** Fresh grated delivers sharper heat that spikes and fades. Prepared creamy horseradish is milder up front but burns longer. Choose based on whether you want a quick strike or sustained impact.

**Kewpie is not optional.** The Japanese formula has MSG that American mayo doesn't. It adds umami depth that makes the whole filling more addictive. If you can't find it, add a pinch of MSG to regular mayo.

**Adjust for your targets.** More jalapeño for heat-seekers. More horseradish for sinus-clearing. More Dijon for complexity. The base recipe is your framework—tune it for maximum impact on your specific audience.

**These hold for hours.** Make them morning-of and refrigerate. Perfect cookout appetizer because they're assembled before guests arrive and deployed on demand.

---

## Why It Works

The timing is everything. The smoke and creamy filling hit immediately—familiar, safe, expected. The heat from the jalapeño and horseradish comes 2-3 seconds later, after they've already swallowed or taken another bite. By then, it's too late.

That's the difference between good and great: the delayed payload. You don't announce the attack. You let them discover it.

**Deploy flavor. Stay spicy.**
